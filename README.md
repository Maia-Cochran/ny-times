## Overview
A minimalist news reader app built in React that displays articles from the [New York Times API Top Stories API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview).

## Learning Goals
Instructions for this solo challenge include creating a React application that allows users to see a list of articles and a ‚Äúdetailed‚Äù view for each article in 8 hours. The goal of this project was to demonstrate the understanding of:

- React fundamentals
- Create multi page UX using React Router
- Frontend best practices
