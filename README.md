## Overview
A minimalist news reader app built in React that displays articles from the [New York Times API Top Stories API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/top-stories-product/1/overview).

## Learning Goals

- React fundamentals
- Create multi page UX using React Router
- Frontend best practices
